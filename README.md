# Debugger-s-Nightmare-AI-Assisted-IDE
A Fun, AI-Powered Debugging Playground
“You don’t learn debugging until debugging breaks you.”

Overview

Debugger's Nightmare is an AI-assisted coding playground where your code is intentionally sabotaged and you are expected to survive. Bugs appear out of nowhere, time runs out faster than expected, and an AI quietly judges your debugging skills while offering help when things go wrong.

This project turns debugging into a challenge instead of a chore.

What Is This?

A controlled chaos environment for developers.
You write code.
The system breaks it.
You fix it.
Or you give up.
Either way, you learn.

Features

Multi-language support (Python, JavaScript, C++)
Nightmare Mode that injects bugs into your code
Learn Mode for peaceful coding
AI-assisted debugging powered by Gemini API
Error explanations and smart hints
Timed execution to simulate real pressure
Sarcastic feedback because debugging is never polite
ACE Editor with syntax highlighting

Modes
Nightmare Mode
Your code is modified without warning. Bugs are injected based on difficulty level. A countdown starts. Debug before time runs out.
Learn Mode
No tricks. No chaos. Just write and run your code normally.
AI Assistance (Gemini API)
When things fall apart, the AI steps in using the Gemini API to:
Explain what went wrong
Point you in the right direction
Help you understand errors without fixing the code for you
The AI assists. You still suffer responsibly.

How It Works

Choose a language.
Select difficulty and mode.
Run the code.
Debug injected issues or ask the AI for help.
Give up if necessary. The system understands.
Why This Exists
To make debugging less boring
To prepare developers for real-world broken code
To practice problem solving under pressure
To learn how errors actually behave
